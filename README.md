ExploratoryAnalysis of Titanic dataset

The Titanic challenge on Kaggle is a competition in which the goal is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing them by their age, their sex, or their passenger class on the boat.

I have been playing around with the data and this notebook details the exploratory data analysis(EDA)steps.
* Data extraction : I will load the dataset and have a first look at it.
* Data cleaning : I will fill in missing values.
* Plotting : I will create charts (bar,histogram and scatter) and use them to spot correlations of the data.

The main libraries I used are:
* Numpy for multidimensional array computing
* Pandas for data manipulation
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
